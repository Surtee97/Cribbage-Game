Game Start:
Game begins by prompting the user to select either 2 or 3 players
The game initializes, shuffles, and then deals a card to each player.
The player with the highest rank card becomes the dealer.
The cards are returned to the deck, shuffled again, and dealt back to each player.
The amount of cards dealt is based on the number of players(6 for 2 players and 5 for 3)

The Crib:
The players then discard cards from their hand into the crib until they have 4 cards.
If there are 3 players, then 1 card is added to the crib directly from the deck.

The Starter:
A card from the deck is determined to be the starter card.
If the starting card is a jack, then the dealer will get points.

The Play:
Players choose cards to play starting with the player whose number is after the dealer's(If the dealer is Player 3, then Player 1 starts)
Each turn the player will place a card and the game will check for any scored points.
If the players hit a total rank sum of 31 or cannot play a card without going over a sum of 31, then the count is reset.
The players will continue placing cards until they run out.

The Show:
The players will get scored for the content of their hands combined with the starter card.
The dealer will get an additional chance to score points using the crib as a second hand.

The End:
The player's hands are shuffled back into the deck.
The dealer becomes a normal player and the player following the original dealer becomes the dealer.

Match Points:
When a player reaches 121 points, they gain a match point.
When a player reaches 3 match points they win the game.
